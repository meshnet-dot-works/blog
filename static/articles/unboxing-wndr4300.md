So the router has arrived. I unboxed it and took some pictures.

Front:

Back:

Lets open it up and see what's inside. If you flip it over and look a the back there are four rubber legs. If you flip them to the side there's a screw behind it in addition to the other two screws, which makes six in total:

When removing the bottom cover there are two cables coming from the back and over to the other side. They lead to two 2.4GHz antennas, which you can see on the next picture.

On the right you can see the two 2.4GHz antennas attached to the inside of the black cover. There are also three more cables which are used for the three 5GHz antennas.

One thing that was a bit disappointing is the metal cover placed over the processor. I'd like to remove it so I can get a good look at the processor and determine for sure which version it is, but not sure how to do that in a non intrusive way.

Knowledge of mesh networks and p2p infrastructure will be increasingly important in the future. If we want to get rid of or minimize large actors we have to take control of our infrastructure as well. Using the services of an ISP is convenient but it means they own the infrastructure and can potentially mess with your traffic if you're doing something they don't like, for whatever reason.

## Contributing

If you have anything you'd like to share within the mesh networking space/community/whatever just make a PR. Consider it more like a wiki where we write about our experiences. Put a `.md` file in the [`articles`](https://github.com/ralphtheninja/meshnet-blog/tree/master/static/articles) folder and images goes into [`images`](https://github.com/ralphtheninja/meshnet-blog/tree/master/static/images).
